# kotd-rp-tracker

Unfortunately since Pushshift is gone, this script no longer works =(

```
RP tracker for r/kickopenthedoor

Gets the (hopefully) accurate RP values of every player in the game since the last RP reset using Pushshift API.

If needed, change the seasonStart variable to the correct timestamp. RP resets at 19:00 UTC on the 1st of every month.
